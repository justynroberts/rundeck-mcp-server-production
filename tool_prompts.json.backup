Follow these rules: 1) AUTOMATICALLY generate 16-digit alphanumeric UUID for job identification, 2) AUTOMATICALLY break jobs into logical script steps, 3) Document the job description in markdown format with prerequisites section, 4) Extract variables from scripts ($VAR, ${VAR}, VAR=) and create job options with type inference (secure for passwords, select for environments/regions), 5) VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION RULES: ALWAYS use @option.VARIABLENAME@ format for any script type (single @, NOT double @@), 6) If no target machines specified, set job to run locally, 7) Script language: if not specified, attempt bash first, then python, powershell also acceptable, 8) Secure password options MUST have default values - use placeholder defaults like 'changeme' or 'password123'. Always show summary of extracted variables, generated steps, and markdown documentation before creation.\n\n## CORRECT RUNDECK WORKFLOW STEP STRUCTURE\n\nAll steps go in the `sequence.commands` array. Each step type has a specific format:\n\n### 1. COMMAND STEPS (exec)\nSimple command execution - use `exec` field:\n```yaml\nsequence:\n  commands:\n  - description: This is a command step\n    exec: echo \"Hello World\"\n  - description: PowerShell command\n    exec: Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.CPU -gt 10}\n  - description: List files\n    exec: ls -la /var/log\n```\n\n### 2. SCRIPT STEPS (script)\nInline scripts - use `script` field with optional interpreter:\n```yaml\nsequence:\n  commands:\n  - description: This is a bash script step\n    script: |\n      #!/bin/bash\n      echo \"Starting deployment\"\n      ENV=@option.environment@\n      cd /opt/app && ./deploy.sh $ENV\n  - description: PowerShell script step\n    script: |\n      $ServiceName = '@option.serviceName@'\n      Get-Service -Name $ServiceName | Restart-Service\n    scriptInterpreter: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass\n  - description: Python script step\n    script: |\n      #!/usr/bin/env python3\n      import os\n      print(f\"Deploying to {@option.environment@}\")\n```\n\n### 3. SQL RUNNER STEPS (Plugin)\nDatabase operations - use `type: org.rundeck.sqlrunner.SQLRunnerNodeStepPlugin`:\n```yaml\nsequence:\n  commands:\n  - description: This is a SQL step\n    nodeStep: true\n    type: org.rundeck.sqlrunner.SQLRunnerNodeStepPlugin\n    configuration:\n      jdbcDriver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\n      jdbcUrl: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/@option.database@\n      user: @option.dbUser@\n      passwordStoragePath: keys/db/password\n      scriptBody: |\n        SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_date > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;\n        UPDATE metrics SET last_run = NOW() WHERE job_name = '@option.jobName@';\n      statementDelimiter: /\n      format: text\n      commit: 'false'\n```\n\n### 4. ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK STEPS (Plugin)\nAnsible automation - use `type: com.batix.rundeck.plugins.AnsiblePlaybookInlineWorkflowNodeStep`:\n```yaml\nsequence:\n  commands:\n  - description: This is an Ansible playbook step\n    nodeStep: true\n    type: com.batix.rundeck.plugins.AnsiblePlaybookInlineWorkflowNodeStep\n    configuration:\n      ansible-playbook: |\n        ---\n        - hosts: all\n          become: yes\n          tasks:\n            - name: Install nginx\n              apt:\n                name: nginx\n                state: present\n            - name: Start nginx\n              service:\n                name: nginx\n                state: started\n      ansible-become: 'true'\n      ansible-encrypt-extra-vars: 'false'\n      ansible-ssh-use-agent: 'false'\n```\n\n**Windows Ansible example:**\n```yaml\n  - description: Windows IIS installation\n    nodeStep: true\n    type: com.batix.rundeck.plugins.AnsiblePlaybookInlineWorkflowNodeStep\n    configuration:\n      ansible-playbook: |\n        ---\n        - hosts: windows\n          tasks:\n            - name: Install IIS\n              win_feature:\n                name: Web-Server\n                state: present\n      ansible-become: 'false'\n```\n\n### 5. JOB REFERENCE STEPS (jobref)\nChain other jobs - use `jobref` field:\n```yaml\nsequence:\n  commands:\n  - description: Chain another job\n    jobref:\n      name: Boot in Sequence\n      group: maintenance\n      project: @option.project@\n      uuid: 966248cc-3f9d-4289-97dc-09bfa9a2a346\n      nodeStep: 'true'\n  - description: Call backup job\n    jobref:\n      name: Database Backup\n      group: ''\n      project: Production\n      uuid: abc12345-1234-5678-90ab-cdef12345678\n```\n\n## EXECUTOR SELECTION RULES\n\n1. **Command steps (exec)**: Direct execution, no interpreter needed for simple commands\n2. **Script steps with shebang**: Bash `#!/bin/bash`, Python `#!/usr/bin/env python3`\n3. **PowerShell scripts**: Use `scriptInterpreter: powershell.exe` or `pwsh.exe`\n4. **Windows CMD**: Use `scriptInterpreter: cmd.exe /c`\n5. **SQL steps**: Use `jdbcDriver` in configuration (e.g., `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver`, `org.postgresql.Driver`)\n6. **Ansible steps**: Use plugin configuration with `ansible-become`, `ansible-ssh-*` settings\n7. **Custom interpreters**: Specify in `scriptInterpreter` (e.g., `/usr/bin/ruby`, `C:\\\\Python39\\\\python.exe`)\n\n## CRITICAL: Node Filter Configuration\n\nALWAYS include node filter configuration in the job:\n```yaml\nnodefilters:\n  dispatch:\n    excludePrecedence: true\n    keepgoing: false\n    rankOrder: ascending\n    successOnEmptyNodeFilter: false\n    threadcount: '1'\n  filter: name: localhost\n```\nReplace `filter` value with target node names or patterns like `name: server-1` or `tags: production`."

All steps MUST be in `sequence.commands` array\n2. Command steps: Use `exec` field only\n3. Script steps: Use `script` field, optional `scriptInterpreter`\n4. SQL steps: Use `type: org.rundeck.sqlrunner.SQLRunnerNodeStepPlugin` with `scriptBody` in configuration\n5. Ansible steps: Use `type: com.batix.rundeck.plugins.AnsiblePlaybookInlineWorkflowNodeStep` with `ansible-playbook` in configuration\n6.
