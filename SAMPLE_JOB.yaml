# CRITICAL RULES:
# - **ANY script (bash/PowerShell/Python) MUST use `script:` type with scriptInterpreter field**
# - **ONLY use `exec:` for single simple commands** (ls, echo, df, etc.)
# - Split scripts into separate steps where logical (setup → process → validate)
# - Always set scriptInterpreter to match your script type (bash, python3, powershell)
# - Use @option.variable@ format for variables in script steps
# - WHERE POSSIBLE, CREATE MULTI-STEP JOBS by chaining commands in sequence.commands array
# - Break complex workflows into logical phases (pre-check, execute, validate, cleanup)
# - Each step should have a clear description of what it does
# - Tags should be relevant to the job's purpose (deployment, monitoring, backup, etc.)
# - UUIDs (id and uuid fields) are auto-generated - do not provide them
# - For Rundeck Enterprise: Use runnerSelector to target specific runners by tag (EMEA, APAC, Americas, etc.)
